Dear Dr.Hoque as I discussed with you am displaying Graph only for 2000th generation 
but not every generation as it's not possible to do it because once it rendering the
chart it's exiting from the applicaiton in order to avoid this what i found in google
is to use threads but it seemed to take some more time and all these i have explained
to you by person . So you told me it's okay to display graph only in 2000th
generation

And aslo I have added screenshots to this folder which shows protein structure 
and their fitness for small protein sequence sometimes i am getting fitness value
given in the input file and some times am not getting because of random orientation
So I have added screenshots that shows fitness( which is in input file for smaller 
protein sequence)

If you have any doubts in my code you can email me, I will come and explain what
it means.

Thank you.
Anoop kumar Nakirakommula.
